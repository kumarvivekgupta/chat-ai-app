# Getting Started with Chat AI App
1- Clone Repo
2- Do npm install
3- npm start to run app locally on system.

Technical Choices:
1- React a better SPA and better performance and easy to maintain.
2- React-Redux because it reduces much of boilerplate code which helps the repo to be light.
3- Tailwind CSS because it provides many classes, and fewer CSS files, and it is performance-optimized, as it shreds unused CSS.


Design Choices:
I have followed the structure for 
1- Components for a superset of pages
2- Pages for layout, which has only one responsibility/feature
3- Feature folder for redux as per the new react-redux-toolkit.

In the Future Hooks folder to contain all custom hooks.

Trade-offs:
Readability, Usability, Convenience 

1- I left the Rich Editor thing, due to time constraints, and for the 1st phase of release, we have a better POC to take forward.
2- If time given I will work to make better designing, thing more about sharing conversation feature and the remaining bonus task RichEditor.
3- As only one page was there, so routing not there, we can include when the use-case arises.
